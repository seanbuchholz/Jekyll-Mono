title: JavaScript30 Challenge and School
author: Sean Buchholz
---

I'm currently wrapping up my last four months at Full Sail University, at then end of which I will have my Bachelor of Science in Web Design & Development (which I, for one, think is pretty cool). This will be my first degree, and I am tremendously excited about it.

So, naturally, as I complete the handful of most difficult courses in my degree program, I thought it would be a good idea to undertake the [JavaScript30 Challenge](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos. Seems like a reasonable time to take on a new project.

In all seriousness, though, I think that vanilla JS solutions are important. Over-reliance on libraries like jQuery or lodash can lead to unnecessarily bloated code, poor future-proofing, and weird hacky workarounds. We see the same thing when we rely on front-end frameworks like Bootstrap to inform our design language. Admittedly, there is a benefit to the consistency and the rapid iteration that becomes available to devs in using these technologies, but at the end of the day, they're crutches. Important and incredibly useful from time to time, but not meant to be relied on in the long term.

Part of me wanted to extend that metaphor way beyond what would have made sense.

Anyway, [this github repo](https://github.com/seanbuchholz/JavaScript30) is where I'm going to be doing all my coding, so keep an eye on that if you want to follow along or help hold me accountable&mdash;or, even better, join the challenge yourself! Let's do it! 

Something something Shia LaBeouf.
