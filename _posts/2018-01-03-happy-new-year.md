If you're reading this, ~~I'm already dead~~ we all survived the 2017 holiday season. For me, it was a hectic two-week hosting extravaganza, as my housemate brought her daughter out to visit DC during Christmas break, then my wife's mother and sister visited the following week to spend some time with our son during his first holiday season on this planet. As I'm sure you can imagine, it was A Lot.

_But._ I'm still here, and I'm recommitting myself to client projects and the job hunt in 2018. Keep posted here for (now regularly-scheduled) blog posts as well as new Portfolio items and a brand new look for this whole shebang coming in the back half of January.
