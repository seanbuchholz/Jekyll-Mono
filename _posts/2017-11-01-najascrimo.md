A dear friend of mine is doing [NaNoWriMo](https://www.nanowrimo.org) this year. I participated (and won!) last year, but I'm too busy this year to participate, with a four-month-old and school and client projects eating up my working time, and Stranger Things season 2 eating up my leisure time (hey, I'm only human).

[Last month]({% post_url 2017-10-05-js30-challenge-and-school %}) I mentioned the JS30 Challenge. So, to make up for not doing NaNo, I'm taking the thirty days of November to write some JavaScript. I already posted the link to my repo but [I'm gonna link it again](https://github.com/seanbuchholz/JavaScript30). For each day I'll create a new branch, complete the challenge, PR that branch against my forked copy's `master`, and then close the PR and delete the branch. This keeps the `master` branch clean, but lets me keep historical records of each of the coding assignments.

Day 1, today, was a JavaScript drum kit soundboard. It was a fun little assignment and though I doubt I'll find a use for the specifics of that project, the concept of linking keydown events to `data-` attributes in the DOM was pretty cool.

Here's to 29 more days of JS.
